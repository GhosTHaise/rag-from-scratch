# 📚 RAG From Scratch

*A practical journey into Retrieval-Augmented Generation*

---

## 🔍 Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) are incredibly powerful — but they are **not always trained on the specific, private, or recent data** that our tasks require.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** solves this problem.

RAG is a methodology that connects LLMs to **external data sources** so they can generate accurate, context-aware responses using information that wasn’t part of their original training set.

This repository follows a clear, progressive approach to understanding RAG **from absolute basics to advanced techniques**.

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

This project (and video series) will guide you through:

### 🧱 **Core Foundations**

* What RAG is and why it matters
* How indexing works
* How retrieval systems fetch relevant data
* How LLMs integrate retrieved knowledge during generation

### 🚀 **Intermediate Concepts**

* Embeddings and vector stores
* Chunking strategies
* Query transformation + rewriting
* Latency optimization

### 🧩 **Advanced Techniques**

* Handling edge cases in retrieval
* Dealing with hallucinations
* Improving relevance and ranking
* Multi-step or multi-vector RAG
* Using domain-specific metadata

## 🧠 Why Build RAG From Scratch?

Modern frameworks simplify RAG, but they also hide how things really work.
Building it manually helps you understand:

* What each step does
* How data flows through a RAG pipeline
* Where bottlenecks appear
* How to customize RAG for your real use-case

If you want to *master* RAG rather than just use it, this is the place.

## 🎥 Video Series

This project is designed to follow along with a video series that incrementally builds a RAG system.
Each step introduces a new concept, followed by hands-on implementation.

> Start with the basics — end with production-ready RAG skills.
